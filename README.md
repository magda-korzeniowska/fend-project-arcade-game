## Project Description

Students were given [a starter project](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) with art assets, game engine and detailed [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true) on how to get started.

A main goal was to convert this static project into an interactive one, editing primarily the JavaScript file - implementing player and enemy classes using Object-Oriented JavaScript.

## Run the Game

In order to run and play the game you can:

* play [here](https://magda-korzeniowska.github.io/fend-project-arcade-game/)
* run the game locally by downloading, cloning or forking this project and opening the `index.html` file in your browser.

## How to Play

- game goal of the Player - to reach the water, without colliding into any of the enemies (bugs)
- start the game by moving the Player with Arrow Keys
- the enemies move in varying speeds on the paved road
- once the player collides with an enemy - the game is reset
- once the player reaches the water 5 times in a row - the game is won
